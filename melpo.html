Lips Correction

</h3>

  <p>A few years ago my daughter had an accident and she needed to make 22 stitches on the lips at the hospital. The next day there was a scheduled video and photo shooting of the children at school by a professional photographer. However, my daughter refused to pose with her injured lips. I decided after the video shooting to edit my daughter's video in After Effects to fix the problem.
